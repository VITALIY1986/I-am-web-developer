There's a lot that we do before actually starting the project. We do market research and analysis, understand the competitive landscape, understand and document clientsâ€™ design and branding preferences, consult with all the key stakeholders and finally come up with a high-level mapping. This brings alignment in terms of end-user persona and business needs.
